Oct 1. Deadline:
- Learned how to make bottom button navigation group
- Refresher on how to organize react native app vs. react app: it was a little challenging at first but I am getting more used to it
- Idea: I wanted to create an aid for students to keep their mental health intact, which will increase their school performance at the same time
- I am in the process of getting firebase setup with this app, and I will use a login interface with a beggining screen before the bottom navigation to store data
- I struggled with filtering at first as I didn't convert to string at first
- Used react native flatlist: https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist
