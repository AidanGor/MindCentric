**Oct 1. Deadline:**
- Learned how to make bottom button navigation group
- Refresher on how to organize react native app vs. react app: it was a little challenging at first but I am getting more used to it
- Idea: I wanted to create an aid for students to keep their mental health intact, which will increase their school performance at the same time
- I am in the process of getting firebase setup with this app, and I will use a login interface with a beggining screen before the bottom navigation to store data
- I struggled with filtering at first as I didn't convert to string at first
- Used react native flatlist: https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist

**Oct. 12th Deadline:**

*Entity Relationship:*
- One entity: list of lists
- Second entity: list of tasks for each list
- Relationship: one to many (1:M), as one list relates to many tasks

*Documentation:*
- Had to restructure navigation structure to stacked navigation within a tab navigator
- Learned how to pass elements between components without parent/child props
- At first, I tried to incorporate firebase to make the data transfering easy. However, I ran into so many issues with setting firebase up because I had to get a com for the project, which required the installation of brew, ruby, cocoapod etc. I ran into a ton of installation, path, and version issues so I eventually decided to save this for a later date and instead transfer through local navigation
- Learned that in RN comments cannot be within a JSX element, even if they are in curly brackets
- Learned how to use useCallback
- I thought that my method of mapping out tasks when editing one specific task was unique but maybe not the most efficient. But it worked anyways!
